	<p>My project is to create an Intranet for a drone enterprise. It should include all the basic functionnalities for an intranet</p>

			<h2>The user management</h2>
			<p>The user management was one of the main part of the project, as it consist in adding users with specific authorizations. Every
				user should be recognize, using an e-mail address and a password that are saved in an SQLite database. 
				To correctly manage everything, I added routes to add, edit and delete users. All this tools are depending of the user "role", as a guest can not edit
				anything, and the administrator ("superuser") can use every tools.

			<h2>Document Import</h2>
			<p>It was in my requirements from the friend I'm creating this Intranet for. He wanted to export and import his CV on this Intranet.
				In order to achieve this, I coded a PDF import. The PDF files as saved in a Mongod database. 
				Same as for the user management, I added routes with methods in order to add or delete PDF files.

			<h2>Events</h2>
			<p>As every intranet, I needed to implement a calendar. The easiest way as i I thought was to integrate the Google Calendar with API.
				Indeed, it was a very good practical exercise, but a very complicated thing to achieve. So, at the end, I only add a route too receive 
				event from the calendar.

	<h2>About This Project</h2>
	<p>At the beginning, I didn't have any specific idea for this project. I though about creating a "CV" website, until I meet someone at a bar
		in my town, Rabastens. This guy, Julien, was working in a drone service enterprise in Montauban. He told to me that he wanted to create his own enterprise
		And he was looking for a developper, as he wanted a new website and an intranet. Moreover, he needed someone that codes in Python, as a lot of the tools he is using
		with drone software are coded in Python. So I propose myself to create the intranet in a first time, and later the website 
		and working on the Python tools. As it was my first real big project, I was probably too optimistic, as I only ended the intranet for the enterprise, Cartotrac.
		I decided to work in Python for the backend, as I learned how to do that in my studies at Holberton School. For the frontend, I wanted to use
		ReactJS as it's interactive, popular and there is a lot of documentation on it.
		Even so it's not perfect, I'm still proud of what I've been able to achieve in only a month. The design isn't clearly the best,
		but I only followed the color requirements from Julien.
		About the functionnalities, I spend a lot of time to debug everything and even now, I'm not sure everyhting will work perfectly for the eternity. But as long as it work for the Demoday,
		every thing should be fine !! 
		Finally, I did this project because it's my portfolio project for Holberton School. I spend the first two weeks creating the backend, the next week on the frontend, 
	four days on the google API, and finally I continued the backend and frontend till the end.</p>
